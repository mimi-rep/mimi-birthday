        <p> Hello My beautiful girl. I wish the girl of my dreams, the one who makes ny heart melt, the one who i want
            to marry a veryyy happy Birthday.
            Safreen, My love you make my life better by being in it and I love you soo much. You my love make my heart
            warm. Your pretty eyes, Your cute voice, Your pretty smile,
            Those absoluetly good lips i get to call mine. Every moment we share, every single time we are together i
            feel at peace, i feel loved. I did not know what love was before you and
            now i don't wanna know anything else about love except you. Your thoughts make me gooo crazyyyyy. I still
            get those warm hug like feelings when i think about us when i dream about
            what we did what we can do. Talking to you every day makes my life better. Well i am not sure what to give
            you as a gift babyy, you know me i cant choose, but You my love are the
            best present i have, the best person i have, my soulmate. I could never ask for anything but you. Your love
            makes me feel, ME. I can't tell you how much you mean to me jaana.
            I love stealing your nicknames but honestly lets be real here, you have better naming sense than me(You are
            naming our kid). Sooo i might as well steal a few right? Welll my love,
            I hope from now on I am the one celebrating everyy single birthday with you. A site this time but maybe next
            year i will be there holding your hands making you smile rather than being sooooo freaking far away from my
            love:(
            Anyways Kanna I have written tooo much. I love you Safreen, Zawjati, my baby, my love, my jaanu, my cutie,
            my sweetie, my baba, my jaana, my kanda, my honeybun, my mimiiiii.
            I will always be yours. You always be mine. You are the best thing that happen to me. I love youuuuuu
            soooooo muchhhhhhhhh.
            <br><br>
